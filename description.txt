The database application will help users search relevant information on Oscar winning films.
In general, the database contains 7 entity sets (movie, movie professionals, genre, watchlist,
award, song, and user) and 11 relevant relationship sets. 

All movie professionals work in certain movies and all movies need professionals to work on
them (full participation and many-to-many). All movies belong to certain genres and
vice versa (full participation and many-to-many). Also, it's worth mentioning that there are
22 types of Oscar awards (some for films, some for film professionals, and one for original 
songs). A movie professional may win certain awards and an award can be awarded to many 
professionals (many-to-many). Similarly, the relationship is many-to-many from movie to award. 
However, all winner songs only get the Best Original Song award (many-to-one). A movie may use 
certain songs and vice versa (many-to-many). From the perspective of the database users, they can 
write reviews for various moives (many-to-many), rent or purchase movies to watch (many-to-many), 
create certain watchlists (one-to-many), and follow these lists (many-to-many). The watchlist may 
contain certain movies and vice versa (many-to-many).
