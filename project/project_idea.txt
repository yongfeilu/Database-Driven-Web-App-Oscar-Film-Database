My final project will center around the Oscar winning films. In general, the 
database will contain 10 entities, which can be roughly divided into 4 categories--
people, films, reviews and awards. As for people entities, there will be
separate relations (or datasets) for actors, directors, writers, producers, music
responsibles, and production companies. Each relation contains basic information
for these people. In the films part, we have film and genre entities. Film 
relation will have attributes descirbing details for all the Oscar winning 
movies, and the genre will include various kinds of movie types. The relation 
for reviews will include both the rating and review content for each review, 
and the relation for awards will contain detailed information for different 
types of Oscar awards.

Obviously, each film can be boiled down to certain genres, have different people 
working on it, receive reviews provided by the movie-goers, and win one or more 
awards. These are the potential relationships we can build upon later in the 
implementaion process. By exploiting these entities and relationships, we can 
build a database system which can perform various functions to efficiently find 
valuable information on moives along with their relevant partners.
